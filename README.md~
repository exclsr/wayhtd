My new tab page on Chrome tries to make me think before jumping into the fun, distracting, confusing web.

It looks like this (with Droid Sans installed):

![Screenshot of wayhtd page, as of 2014.05.30](/assets/wayhtd_screenshot.jpg)

It is just a single image, a tiny CSS file, and an HTML file. It's somewhat responsive. It could probably look nicer.

_Hey, wait a minute,_ you say. _Chrome won't let me set a different file or URL as my "New Tab Page"!_

But Chrome **does** let _extensions_ set a specific New Tab Page. I use [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna); there are [others with more or fewer features](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search-extensions/new%20tab%20redirect).
